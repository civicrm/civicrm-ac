    <h1>CiviCRM active contributor framework</h1>
    <p>The active contributor framework tracks <a href="{{ url('contributor_index') }}">contributors</a> and <a href="{{ url('task_index') }}">contributions</a> to CiviCRM.</p>
    <p><i>This is an early-days work in progress.  We are currently showing a very incomplete account of contributions to CiviCRM and are not ready for prime time.</i></p>
    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>The active contributor framework serves a central repository for the recording of tasks so they can be made available for various consumers, e.g. civicrm.org and your professional/personal website.</p>
    <h2>More info</h2>
    You can find out more about the framework on the <a href="https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-ac">active contributor github repo</a>. Also check out the <a href="https://civicrm.org/blog">CiviCRM blog</a> for updates on progress.</p>
    <h2>Feedback and involvement</h2>
    <p>Feedback is welcome, especially on tasks that we should be recording but are not.</p>
    <p>You can help complete an accurate picture of contributions made to CiviCRM by joining the active contributor working group.</p>
